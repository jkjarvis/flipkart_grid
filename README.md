# Warranty Systems using NFTs

## Problem Statement

The objective is to replace the physical warranty and have block chain based warranty using NFT which will ensure
authenticity and security.
* Converting ownership authenticity and product warranty cards into decaying NFTs.
* For instance, allow brands and retailers to introduce an NFT for each of their products, which allows
customers to receive the physical product along with a digital version of it.
* Customers can then use the digital NFT to verify the authenticity of their product, prove their ownership of
their product, and transfer ownership of them upon resale.
* The brand/retailer should also be able to tie the digital NFT to its warranty program, allowing owners to track
repairs and replacements to the original item.
* Decay the NFT once the warranty is over.
* You can use the Polygon blockchain to deploy your solution and demo the final product as a web prototype.
